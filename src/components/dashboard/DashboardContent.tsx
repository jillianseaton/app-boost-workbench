              Our task optimization system uses advanced algorithms to simulate real-world 
              application testing scenarios. When you complete a task, you're helping improve 
              the performance and user experience of various applications and services.

              <strong>The Process:</strong>

            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 mb-3">
              <li>Select an optimization task from available applications</li>
              <li>Run the simulation which tests various performance metrics</li>
              <li>Receive earnings based on the complexity and duration of the task</li>
              <li>Earnings are automatically converted to Bitcoin at current market rates</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The earning amounts are determined by factors including task complexity, 
              current Bitcoin price, and overall platform performance. Higher-value tasks 
              may become available as you complete more optimizations and build your reputation.
